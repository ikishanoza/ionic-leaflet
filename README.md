# ionic-leaflet
Hi I have created this project as part of one of my other project. Google map API's are too much costly and may be for any small organization its not possible to use google API.
so I have used leaflefjs[https://leafletjs.com/] for displaying the map and openstreetmap[https://www.openstreetmap.org/] to search location just like google autocomplete.

If you like the project please do fork and start the repository.

If you want any inhancement or something is not working please open issue or you can reach me out at ikishan.oza@gmail.com


Thanks Cheers!!
